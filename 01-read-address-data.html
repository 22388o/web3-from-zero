<h1>1. Reading Address Data</h1>

<p>
  Addresses form the core of blockchains. What IPs are for the Internet address are for the
  blockchain. Smart contracts and externally owned accounts, short EOAs, are the targets of those
  addresses.
</p>

<p>
  An address is 20 byte number derived from a public key and is usually displayed as 40 hex digits.
  They look something like this <code>0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045</code>. More on
  that later.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note: </b>An address is used to send and receive data or funds. The money is gone when you send
  tokens to the wrong address because of a typo. So always save you have the correct address.
  <b>Nobody can recover you from such an error!</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A smart contract is a program deployed on the blockchain and autonomously executed by nodes
  (computers) that make up the Ethereum network.
</p>
  
<p>
  An EOA is an address controlled by a private/public key pair owner from outside the Ethereum
  network; thus, the name <b>externally</b> owned account. Usually, you use wallet software to
  manage EOA keys and addresses.
</p>

<p>
  These addresses, both smart contracts and EOAs, have data associated with them. The Ethereum
  blockchain stores this data, and you can read and write it if you have the correct permissions. In
  this lesson, you will just read data. As you can see in Figure 1, you can't write on the
  blockchain without a wallet.

<h2>Reading the Transaction Count of an Address</h2>

<p>
  To read data, you need an Ethers.js provider but also a target address. Let's start with the
  transaction (TX) count. It's a simple numeric value stored on the chain for every address that was
  part of such a TX. It gets incremented by 1 if another TX with that address happens.
</p>

<p>
  Ethers.js providers offer a <code>getTransactionCount</code> method that returns a promise that 
  resolves to a TX count, so you have to <code>await</code> it.
</p>

<p>
  Try it out in the editor! Call the method and <code>print</code> its result. The method expects an
  address as <code>string</code> argument, so here a few you can use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Developer DAO NFT Smart Contract:<br>
    <code>0xdd00Cc906B93419814443Bb913949d503B3DF3c4</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    GitCoin MultiSig Smart Contract:<br>
    <code>0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Vitalik Buterin EOA:<br>
    <code>0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<code-editor>
  const address = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
  const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider()
  // Write your code here!
  <p>
    const transactionCount = await provider.getTransactionCount(address)
    print(transactionCount)
  </p>
</code-editor>

<h2>Reading the Balance at an Address</h2>

<p>
  Reading the balance of an address is a bit more complex than reading the TX count.
</p>

<p>
  Both, smart contracts and EOAs, have an Ether balance, the native currency, or more precisely, the
  <b>native token</b> of the Ethereum network. Ether's primary use-case is paying for TX fees on the
  Ethereum network.
</p>

<p>
  Using a provider's <code>getBalance</code> method, you can read the Ether balance of an address.
  Again, this method returns a promise, so you have to <code>await</code> it.
</p>

<p>
  Try it out in the editor! Call the method and <code>print</code> its result. The method expects an
  address as <code>string</code> argument, so here a few you can use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Developer DAO NFT Smart Contract:<br>
    <code>0xdd00Cc906B93419814443Bb913949d503B3DF3c4</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    GitCoin MultiSig Smart Contract:<br>
    <code>0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Vitalik Buterin EOA:<br>
    <code>0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<code-editor>
  const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider()
  // Write your code here!
  <p>
    const balance = await provider.getBalance(
      "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
    )
    print(balance)
  </p>
</code-editor>

<p>
  So, we got the balance, but why does it look like that?
</p>

<h2>The BigNumber Type</h2>

<p>
  Ethers.js packaged the balance with its own <code>BigNumber</code> type, because the value is too
  big for JavaScript's <code>Number</code> type to store. You have to convert the balance to a string
  with the right amount of decimal points to display it in a human-readable way.
</p>

<p>
  One of the main differences between Ethereum and JavaScript are number types. For a long time,
  every numerical value was of type <code>Number</code> in JavaScript, which is a double-precision
  (64bit) floating-point format</double-precisi>. Every numerical value <b>was</b> stored like that,
  because some time ago it got a new number type called 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt" target="_blank">
  <code>BigInt</code></a> for very large integer values.
</p>

<p>
  Everything is an integer in Solidity, the programming language to develop smart contracts for
  Ethereum. Solidity is mainly concerned with payment, and floating-point values have some quirks
  that can cost you money, so they opted for going integer only. Solidity always stores numbers as
  integers, and the most common type is <code>uint256</code> (alias <code>uint</code>) which can
  store 78 decimal digits. In comparison, JavaScript's <code>Number</code> type can only store 16
  digits. 
</p>

<p>
  Tokens can have more than 16 digits, so they're too big for <code>Number</code>. Addresses are
  also stored as integers and are 20 byte big (40 hex digits). 20 byte are 160 bit, so they don't
  fit into the 64 bit <code>Number</code> type either. That's why you use a <code>String</code> to
  store addresses in JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
  Since Ethers.js wants to be backwards compatible with older JavaScript versions that don't support 
  <code>BigInt</code>, they implemented their own integer type called <code>BigNumber</code>. It
  comes with <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/bignumber/#BigNumber--methods" target="_blank">
  methods for basic arithmetics</a>, but can also be converted to <code>String</code> or
  <code>BigInt</code> when needed.
</p>

<h2>Converting to a Readable Format</h2>

<p>
  The last exercise yielded a <code>BigNumber</code> object that isn't easily human-readable. While
  it's enough to work with the value inside of our code, you should convert it to a 
  <code>String</code> before you show it to a user.
</p>

<p>
  To do so, you can use
  <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/display-logic/#display-logic--functions"> utility
  functions</a> Ethers.js includes. The <code>formatUnits</code> function will automatically convert
  a <code>BigNumber</code> to a <code>string</code> with the right decimal points. Which is handy to
  display a balance to a user.
</p>

<p>
  Try to convert the <code>BigNumber</code> to a <code>string</code> and <code>print</code> it!
</p>

<p>
  The <code>formatUnits</code> function can be found in the <code>ethers.utils</code> object. This
  time it returns the result right away, so no <code>await</code> required.
</p>

<code-editor>
  const address = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
  const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider()
  const balance = await provider.getBalance(address)
  // Write your code here!
  <p>
    const readableBalance = ethers.utils.formatUnits(balance) + " ETH"
    print(readableBalance)
  </p>
</code-editor>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  In this lesson, you learned that addresses are the fundament of the Ethereum blockchain and that 
  externally owned accounts and smart contracts are the targets of those addresses.
</p>

<p>
  Addresses are 160 bits or 20 bytes, integers usually displayed as 40 hex digits, and JavaScript
  can't store them in its native <code>Number</code> type because it's only 8 bytes big. The same
  goes for token balances, which can have more than 16 digits a <code>Number</code> could store.
</p>

<p>
  In <a href="02-connect-to-contracts.html">the next lesson</a>, you will learn how to interact with
  smart contracts.
